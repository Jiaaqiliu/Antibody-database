**Subject:** Re: Antibody Database Explorer — Progress Update

Hi Ian,

Thanks for the feedback!

I've put together a static HTML snapshot of the current interface — you can open it directly in your browser to get a sense of the layout and visualizations. I'll attach it to this email.

That said, since it's a static file, it won't let you interact with the filters or see live calculations. If you'd like to play around with the full functionality, I can set up a hosted demo that you can access via a URL — just let me know and I'll get that ready.

Good to know about the additional fields coming for antibodies and targets. We can incorporate those as they become available.

The side-by-side comparison for FDA Label vs. CTGOV is a great idea — I'll look into adding that as a feature.

Best,
Jiaqi
